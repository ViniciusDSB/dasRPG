This is just a simple project my teacher requested to learn some object oriented programming concepts. <br>

-In the directory where dasRpg/ is saved run the following command:<br><br>
javac -d ./dasRPG/RPG/ -sourcepath dasRpg dasRpg/*.java dasRpg/roles/*.java dasRpg/weapons/*.java dasRpg/weapons/clericWpns/*.java dasRpg/weapons/wizardWpns/*.java dasRpg/weapons/paladinWpns/*.java
<br><br>
-Then run:
cd dasRPG/RPG/
<br><br>
-And start the game by running:
java dasRpg.Master
<br><br>
Test input:<br>
3 10 6 4 1<br>
1 10 5 6 1<br>
